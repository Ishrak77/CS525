# CS425_Project
The Memristive Image Reconstructor (MIR) accelerates image reconstruction in medical imaging using compute-in-memory (CIM) with memristor arrays. By implementing quasi-analogue mapping (QAM) and complex matrix transfer (CMT) techniques, MIR achieves high-fidelity MRI and CT image reconstructions with superior speed and energy efficiency. Compared to traditional GPU systems, MIR shows 153× improvement in energy efficiency and 79× faster reconstruction speed. This system provides software-equivalent image quality and DICE scores after segmentation with nnU-Net. MIR demonstrates the potential of memristor-based CIM for high-performance medical imaging and beyond.
